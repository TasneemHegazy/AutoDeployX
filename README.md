## AutoDeployX

Welcome to the AutoDeployX project repository! This repository showcases my proficiency in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) techniques for achieving automated build and deployment of cloud-based software products.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in the following areas:

- Explaining the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.
- Designing and building CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes, utilizing Deployment Strategies.
- Utilizing a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Utilizing centralized structured logging to surface critical server errors for diagnosis.
